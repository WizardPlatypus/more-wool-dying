# What is this project?

This is a minecraft datapack that adds recipes for redying wool.

# What kind of recipes?

All the recipes are "shaped" and follow this template:

```
WWW
WDW
WWW
```

where W stands for wool and D stand for dye.

The dye must be surronded by the wool of the same color. Redying wool into it's own color is not supported.

This is an extended version of a datapack by [JedyJeffatHype at Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/8-wool-per-dye/).

I am really not sure how licensing works in this case(I am a newbie), but it shan't stop me from developing the pack.
