# What is this project?

This is a minecraft datapack that adds recipes for redying wool.

# What kind of recipes?

All the recipes are "shaped" and follow this template:

```
WWW
WDW
WWW
```

where W stands for wool and D stand for dye.

The dye can be surronded by wool of any color, except redying wool into it's own color is not supported.

# License

This project evolved form the datapack created by [JedyJeffatHype at Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/8-wool-per-dye/).

Though the only thing left untouched from that pack is pack.png file, I am really not sure how licensing works in this case(I am a newbie), so let's just say I am not responisble for any consequences of anybody's use of this datapack.

# Todo

* Advancements logic still need some work, but I am not willing to do anything about it for now.
* The pack format that is used at the moment is probably outdated, but seems to work just fine, so I have not touched it either.

# How to use the datapack?

Download this code as a zip archive and place it in the datapacks folder of your world... Done!
